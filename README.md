# Blog-Api-with-Role-Auth-Pagination-and-Filtering-Spring-Boot-Api

Project: Blog API with Role-Based Authentication, Pagination, and Filtering

Description:
Developed a feature-rich Blog API using Spring Boot, incorporating role-based authentication, pagination, and filtering capabilities. The API empowered users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts, while ensuring data privacy and security.

Technologies Used:
- Spring Boot
- Java
- Spring Security
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- MySQL (or your preferred database)

Key Contributions:
- Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints to enable CRUD operations for blog posts.
- Utilized Spring Security for role-based access control, allowing users with different roles (e.g., admin, author, reader) to perform specific actions.
- Implemented token-based authentication using JWT to enhance security and manage user sessions efficiently.
- Developed filtering options for blog posts, enabling users to search for specific posts based on criteria like date, category, or author.
- Implemented pagination to manage large datasets, optimizing API performance and reducing response times.
- Designed the database schema for MySQL, effectively storing blog post information, user details, and role permissions.
- Conducted thorough testing to validate the API's functionality and security, including unit tests and integration testing.
- Implemented data validation and error handling to ensure data integrity and improve the API's robustness.
- Documented the API endpoints, filtering options, and role-based permissions to assist developers and stakeholders in integrating and understanding the functionality.
- Utilized version control (e.g., Git) to track code changes and enable collaboration with the development team.

Results:
- Successfully delivered a highly functional Blog API with role-based authentication, pagination, and filtering capabilities, enhancing the user experience and security.
- Improved system performance and scalability through pagination and filtering, ensuring optimal API responses for varying data loads.
- Enhanced data privacy and security by enforcing role-based access control and JWT-based authentication.
- Received positive feedback from the development team and project stakeholders for meeting project objectives and delivering high-quality code.
